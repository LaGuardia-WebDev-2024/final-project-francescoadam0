           I have been dancing since I was a little boy. Well not that little. Some would say that for a boy, I started late meanwhile I was 7 when I started dancing. Most people usually start when they are 2 or 3 or 4. My dance experience is different. Growing up in my elementary and middle school was rough. I have been bullied, teased and made fun of my entire life because I was a dancer, not only because I was a male dancer but because I was a straight male dancer. Usual responses would be "kill yourself" or "why dont you play a real mans' sport like basketball or football". But that never stopped me from quitting dance. Dance is my life and people on the outside dont realize that.

          A little more background on my dance training. I am currently a Senior Dance Major at LaGuardia High School in Manhattan and I am a company dancer at TKO Dance Academy located in Ozone Park Queens. Over the last 4 years I have been training every single day in strictly Classical Ballet and Modern Techniques like the Horton , Limon and Graham Techniques. 2 classes a day ( 1 modern and 1 ballet) each being 80 minutes. Junior year I would do Jazz and Tap and even take Choreography but those are not the main focuses of a rigerous program here at LaG. This could be dreadful for some but for me this is what I want. I want to be a professional dancer in college and I want this strict cirriculum because I know it is what I need to be the best dancer I can be. The program here at LaGuardia is very strict as they only want what is best for you and they set you in the right path for success. My high school experience here was one of a kind and I could not imagine going anywhere else. Now that I have had training under LaGuardia for the last 4 years and will be graduating in less than a month. I am proud to say that I will be attending SUNY Purchase to join their Conservatory of Dance to earn my BFA in Dance.
